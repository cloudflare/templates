# x402 Payment-Gated Proxy

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/x402-proxy-template)

A Cloudflare Worker that acts as a transparent proxy with payment-gated access using the [x402 v2 protocol](https://x402.org) and stateless cookie-based authentication.

**Live Demo** - Try the built-in endpoints (other routes will fail as no origin is configured):

- [/\_\_x402/health](https://x402proxy-template.news.eti.cfdata.org/__x402/health) - Public health check (200 OK)
- [/\_\_x402/protected](https://x402proxy-template.news.eti.cfdata.org/__x402/protected) - Protected endpoint (402 Payment Required)

<!-- dash-content-start -->

## Overview

This template implements a **smart proxy** that:

1. **Forwards all requests** to the origin server by default
2. **Intercepts protected routes** based on configurable patterns
3. **Requires payment** via the x402 protocol for protected routes
4. **Issues JWT cookies** valid for 1 hour after payment
5. **Allows access** to protected routes without additional payments during the valid period

> **Note:** This template ships with Base Sepolia (`eip155:84532`) and Solana devnet (`solana:EtWTRABZaYq6iMfeYKouRu166VU2xqa1`) out of the box. Set `NETWORK` to a single entry to advertise only one.

### Use Cases

This proxy is ideal for:

- **API Monetization** - Charge per API request or time-based access
- **Premium Content** - Paywall specific routes without modifying your backend
- **Rate Limiting with Payments** - Convert rate limits into paid tiers
- **Microservice Access Control** - Add payment gates to existing services
- **Demo/Testing Payment Flows** - Prototype payment-gated services quickly

### Key Features

- 🔄 **Transparent Proxy** - Forwards all non-protected requests unchanged
- 🎯 **Pattern-Based Protection** - Configure which routes require payment
- 🔐 **Stateless Authentication** - JWT cookies with HMAC-SHA256 signatures
- 💰 **x402 Protocol Integration** - Accept crypto payments for access
- 🍪 **Cookie-Based Sessions** - No server-side storage required
- ⚡ **Edge Computing** - Runs on Cloudflare Workers at the edge
- 🔒 **Secure** - HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies
- 📦 **Lightweight** - Minimal overhead, custom JWT implementation (~2-3 KB)

## Quick Start

Get up and running in under 2 minutes:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure JWT secret for local development
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
node -e "console.log('JWT_SECRET=' + require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))" >> .dev.vars

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:8787` to see the proxy in action.

- Try `http://localhost:8787/__x402/health` for a public endpoint
- Try `http://localhost:8787/__x402/protected` to see payment requirements

## Getting Started

> _Already ran Quick Start above? Skip to [How It Works](#how-it-works)._

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Cloudflare account (for deployment)
- A wallet address to receive payments (see [Getting a Wallet Address](#getting-a-wallet-address) below)
- Testnet USDC for testing payments on either chain (get it from the [Circle faucet](https://faucet.circle.com))
- No testnet ETH or SOL is needed for the payment flow: EVM payments are signed offline with EIP-3009, Solana payments use the facilitator's `extra.feePayer`, and the facilitator submits the transaction

### Getting a Wallet Address

You need a recipient address for every enabled network family:

- `PAY_TO` for EVM networks. Any Ethereum-compatible wallet works—use an existing wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.) or create one programmatically with [CDP Server Wallets](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/server-wallets/v2/introduction/quickstart).
- `PAY_TO_SOLANA` for Solana networks. Any standard Solana wallet works.

> **Solana recipients need an existing token account.** The x402 v2 `exact`
> scheme transfers to the recipient's associated token account but does not
> create it. If `PAY_TO_SOLANA` has never held the payment asset (e.g. USDC),
> send it any amount of that token once — payment verification fails with a
> simulation error until the token account exists.

The default Solana incinerator already has a token account for devnet USDC.

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

#### Configuration Options

The proxy is configured via environment variables in `wrangler.jsonc`:

| Variable             | Required   | Description                                      | Example                          |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `PAY_TO`             | For EVM    | EVM wallet address to receive payments           | `"0x..."`                        |
| `PAY_TO_SOLANA`      | For Solana | Base58 Solana wallet address to receive payments | `"YourSolanaWalletAddress"`      |
| `NETWORK`            | Yes        | One CAIP-2 network or a comma-separated list     | `"eip155:84532"`                 |
| `JWT_SECRET`         | Yes        | Secret for signing auth tokens (set as secret)   | (64 hex chars)                   |
| `PROTECTED_PATTERNS` | Yes        | Array of route pricing configurations            | See below                        |
| `ORIGIN_URL`         | No         | External URL to proxy to (if not using DNS)      | `"https://api.example.com"`      |
| `ORIGIN_SERVICE`     | No         | Service Binding to origin Worker                 | Configured in wrangler.jsonc     |
| `FACILITATOR_URL`    | No         | x402 facilitator endpoint                        | `"https://x402.org/facilitator"` |

#### Networks

`NETWORK` accepts a CAIP-2 identifier or a comma-separated list. Every protected route advertises one payment option per configured network.

| Network        | CAIP-2 identifier                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Base Sepolia   | `eip155:84532`                            |
| Base           | `eip155:8453`                             |
| Solana mainnet | `solana:5eykt4UsFv8P8NJdTREpY1vzqKqZKvdp` |
| Solana devnet  | `solana:EtWTRABZaYq6iMfeYKouRu166VU2xqa1` |

Network identifiers are [CAIP-2](https://chainagnostic.org/CAIPs/caip-2). Live facilitator and network support is listed under [Facilitators](https://docs.x402.org/dev-tools/facilitators):

```jsonc
"NETWORK": "eip155:84532,solana:EtWTRABZaYq6iMfeYKouRu166VU2xqa1"
```

When combining families, configure both `PAY_TO` and `PAY_TO_SOLANA`.

#### PROTECTED_PATTERNS

Each entry defines a protected route and its payment requirements:

```jsonc
"PROTECTED_PATTERNS": [
  {
    "pattern": "/premium/*",
    "price": "$0.01",
    "description": "Access to premium content for 1 hour"
  },
  {
    "pattern": "/api/pro/*",
    "price": "$0.10",
    "description": "Pro API access"
  }
]
```

#### Facilitators

The default `https://x402.org/facilitator` is for testnet development. Multiple facilitators are live in production, supporting various networks including Base, Solana, Polygon, Avalanche, and more. See [Facilitators](https://docs.x402.org/dev-tools/facilitators) for production options.

#### Proxy Modes

The proxy supports three modes for routing requests to your backend. Choose based on your architecture:

##### DNS-Based Mode (Default)

**Best for:** Traditional backend servers (VMs, containers, other hosting providers)

When `ORIGIN_URL` is **not set**, requests are forwarded to the origin server defined in your Cloudflare DNS records.

**Setup:**

1. Add a DNS record in Cloudflare pointing to your origin server:
   - Type: `A` (for IP address) or `CNAME` (for hostname)
   - Name: `api` (or your subdomain)
   - Content: Your origin server IP or hostname
   - Proxy status: **Proxied** (orange cloud)

2. Configure a route in `wrangler.jsonc`:

   ```jsonc
   "routes": [
     { "pattern": "api.example.com/*", "zone_name": "example.com" }
   ]
   ```

3. Deploy. The proxy will forward requests to your origin server automatically.

```
User → api.example.com → x402 Proxy → Origin Server (via DNS)
```

##### External Origin Mode

**Best for:** Another Cloudflare Worker, or any external service with a public URL

When `ORIGIN_URL` **is set**, requests are rewritten to that URL. This lets you proxy to another Worker on a Custom Domain or any external API.

**Setup:**

1. Set `ORIGIN_URL` in `wrangler.jsonc`:

   ```jsonc
   "vars": {
     "ORIGIN_URL": "https://my-origin-worker.example.com",
     // ... other vars
   }
   ```

2. If your origin is a Worker, deploy it with a [Custom Domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/).

3. Deploy the proxy. Requests are rewritten to the origin URL while preserving the original `Host` header.

```
User → api.example.com → x402 Proxy → my-origin-worker.example.com (URL rewrite)
```

**Why External Origin mode?** Cloudflare routes a hostname to one Worker only. You can't chain Workers on the same hostname via routing. External Origin mode solves this by rewriting the URL to a different hostname where your origin Worker lives.

##### Service Binding Mode

**Best for:** Another Cloudflare Worker in your account (fastest option)

When `ORIGIN_SERVICE` **is bound**, requests are sent directly to the bound Worker with zero network overhead. Both Workers run on the same thread.

**Setup:**

1. Add a service binding in `wrangler.jsonc`:

   ```jsonc
   "services": [
     { "binding": "ORIGIN_SERVICE", "service": "my-origin-worker" }
   ]
   ```

2. Deploy. The proxy will call the origin Worker directly via the binding.

```
User → api.example.com → x402 Proxy → Origin Worker (via Service Binding)
```

**Why Service Binding mode?** [Service Bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/) provide the fastest Worker-to-Worker communication with no network hop. The origin Worker doesn't even need a public route.

##### Quick Comparison

| Mode            | Config           | Origin Type           | Use Case                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| DNS-Based       | (default)        | Traditional server    | Your backend is a VM, container, or external host |
| External Origin | `ORIGIN_URL`     | Worker or any URL     | Your backend is another Worker or external API    |
| Service Binding | `ORIGIN_SERVICE` | Worker (same account) | Fastest option for Worker-to-Worker               |

#### Local Development Setup

1. **Copy the example environment file:**

   ```bash
   cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
   ```

2. **Generate a secure JWT secret:**

   ```bash
   node -e "console.log('JWT_SECRET=' + require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))" >> .dev.vars
   ```

3. **Verify your `.dev.vars` file contains:**
   ```bash
   JWT_SECRET=<your-generated-secret>
   ```

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:8787`

## How It Works

### Key Implementation Details

Understanding the core concepts will help you configure and use this proxy effectively.

#### Stateless JWT Authentication

The proxy uses a custom JWT implementation built on Web Crypto API:

- **Signing:** HMAC-SHA256 with secret key
- **Payload:** `{ paid: true, iat, exp }`
- **Validation:** Signature verification + expiration check
- **Size:** ~2-3 KB minified (no dependencies)

#### Payment Flow

1. Client requests protected route (e.g., `/premium`) without cookie
2. Proxy responds with `402 Payment Required` + payment details
3. Client creates a signed payment for one advertised EVM or Solana option
4. Client retries the request with the v2 `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header
5. x402 middleware verifies payment via facilitator
6. Proxy issues JWT cookie + forwards request to origin
7. Subsequent requests use cookie (valid for 1 hour) - no payment needed
8. Origin server receives authenticated requests transparently

**Key insight:** The origin server never knows about the payment logic. It just receives authenticated requests as if the proxy wasn't there.

### Proxy Behavior

The worker acts as a **transparent proxy** that forwards all requests to your origin server, except for routes matching the `PROTECTED_PATTERNS` configuration.

### Public Routes (Default)

Any route NOT in `PROTECTED_PATTERNS` is forwarded directly to the origin:

```bash
curl https://your-worker.dev/any-path
# → Proxied directly to origin server
```

### Protected Routes

Routes matching `PROTECTED_PATTERNS` require payment or a valid authentication cookie:

**Without payment or cookie:**

- Returns `402 Payment Required`
- Includes base64-encoded v2 payment requirements in the `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header

**With valid payment:**

- Verifies payment via x402 facilitator
- Issues JWT cookie (valid for 1 hour)
- Proxies request to origin server

**With valid cookie:**

- Validates JWT signature and expiration
- Proxies request to origin immediately (no payment required)

### Example: `/premium` endpoint

```bash
# First request without auth
curl https://your-worker.dev/premium
# → 402 Payment Required

# Request with payment
curl https://your-worker.dev/premium -H "PAYMENT-SIGNATURE: <encoded-payment>"
# → Cookie issued + request proxied to origin

# Subsequent requests with cookie
curl https://your-worker.dev/premium -H "Cookie: auth_token=..."
# → Proxied to origin (no payment needed)
```

## Testing

### Automated Testing

Run the automated test client:

```bash
# EVM
PRIVATE_KEY=0x... npm run test:client

# Solana (base58 private key; devnet RPC is the default)
SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY=... npm run test:client

# Optional custom Solana RPC
SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY=... SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://... npm run test:client
```

This will:

1. Request `/premium` without payment (receives 402)
2. Create and sign a payment with your wallet
3. Submit payment and receive premium content
4. Extract JWT cookie
5. Test cookie authentication (no payment needed)

See [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) for detailed testing instructions.

### Manual Testing with curl

1. **Test public endpoint:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/__x402/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok","proxy":"x402-proxy","message":"This endpoint is always public",...}
```

2. **Request protected endpoint (no payment):**

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8787/__x402/protected
# Returns 402 with payment requirements
```

3. **Request with payment (requires x402 SDK):**
   See test-client.ts for implementation example

> **Note:** Automated testing with `npm run test:client` requires a funded wallet with testnet tokens. If you're just evaluating the template, the Playwright tests (`pnpm test:e2e x402-proxy-template` from repo root) cover core functionality without requiring payments.

## Advanced Configuration

### Proxy Architecture

The worker uses a single catch-all middleware that:

1. **Checks path** against `PROTECTED_PATTERNS`
2. **For unprotected paths**: Proxies request immediately to origin
3. **For protected paths**:
   - Checks for valid JWT cookie
   - If no valid cookie, requires x402 payment
   - Issues JWT cookie on successful payment
   - Proxies authenticated request to origin

The proxy mode (DNS-based, External Origin, or Service Binding) determines how requests reach your backend. See [Proxy Modes](#proxy-modes) for details.

### Configuration Examples

**Single route with one price:**

```jsonc
"PROTECTED_PATTERNS": [
  {
    "pattern": "/premium",
    "price": "$0.01",
    "description": "Access to premium content for 1 hour"
  }
]
```

**Multiple routes with different prices:**

```jsonc
"PROTECTED_PATTERNS": [
  {
    "pattern": "/premium",
    "price": "$0.01",
    "description": "Basic premium access"
  },
  {
    "pattern": "/api/pro/*",
    "price": "$0.10",
    "description": "Pro API access"
  },
  {
    "pattern": "/dashboard",
    "price": "$1.00",
    "description": "Full dashboard access"
  }
]
```

**Wildcard patterns:**

```jsonc
"PROTECTED_PATTERNS": [
  {
    "pattern": "/api/private/*",
    "price": "$0.05",
    "description": "Private API access"
  }
]
```

## Security Considerations

### Cookie Security

Cookies are configured with security best practices:

- `HttpOnly`: Prevents JavaScript access (XSS protection)
- `Secure`: HTTPS only in production
- `SameSite=Strict`: CSRF protection
- 1-hour expiration: Limits exposure window

### JWT Security

- Secret key stored in environment variables (not in code)
- HMAC-SHA256 cryptographic signing
- Expiration validation on every request
- No sensitive data in payload

### Payment Security

- All payments verified through facilitator
- Client cannot forge payment proofs
- Payment amount validation
- Network/token validation

## Bot Management Filtering (Optional)

With **Bot Management for Enterprise** enabled on your domain, x402-proxy can distinguish between human and automated traffic:

- Humans can access protected routes without payment
- Bots are charged unless explicitly exempted
- You can allow specific crawlers (e.g., Googlebot, search engines) free access

### Configuration Example

```jsonc
"PROTECTED_PATTERNS": [
  {
    "pattern": "/api/premium/*",
    "price": "$0.10",
    "description": "Premium API access",
    "bot_score_threshold": 30,           // Lower score = more likely automated
    "except_detection_ids": [
      120623194,  // Googlebot
      132995013   // ChatGPT-User
    ]
  }
]
```

The configuration uses two settings:

- `bot_score_threshold` (1-99) - determines the cutoff for blocking bot traffic and allowing humans through. See [Bot Score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/) for how scores are calculated.
- `except_detection_ids` - array of bot detection IDs to whitelist. A sample list is available in [`src/bots.ts`](./src/bots.ts).

Without Bot Management, all traffic to protected routes requires payment.

## Deployment

### Production Deployment

> **Important:** For production, use a mainnet CAIP-2 network and a facilitator that supports it. The default x402.org facilitator is testnet-only.

1. **Set up secrets:**

```bash
wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET
# Enter your production JWT secret
```

2. **Update configuration:**
   Edit `wrangler.jsonc` with your production wallet address and mainnet network

3. **Deploy:**

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Environment-Specific Configuration

For multiple environments (dev/staging/prod), use [Wrangler environments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#environments).

## Development

### Code Quality

The project enforces code quality through:

- **TypeScript** - Full type safety
- **ESLint** - Code quality rules
- **Prettier** - Consistent formatting
- **Pre-commit checks** - All checks run via `npm run lint`

### Adding New Protected Routes

Simply add a new entry to `PROTECTED_PATTERNS` in `wrangler.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
	"vars": {
		"PROTECTED_PATTERNS": [
			{
				"pattern": "/premium",
				"price": "$0.01",
				"description": "Premium content access",
			},
			{
				"pattern": "/api/private/*",
				"price": "$0.05",
				"description": "Private API access",
			},
			{
				"pattern": "/dashboard",
				"price": "$0.10",
				"description": "Dashboard access",
			},
		],
	},
}
```

**That's it!** No code changes needed. The proxy will automatically:

- Require payment for routes matching any pattern
- Apply the correct price for each route
- Issue cookies after payment
- Forward authenticated requests to your origin server

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid payment" error

- Check wallet has enough testnet tokens
- Verify you're on Base Sepolia network
- Ensure payment amount matches requirement

### Cookie doesn't work

- Check cookie isn't expired (1 hour validity)
- Verify JWT_SECRET is set in `.dev.vars`
- Ensure cookie is being sent in request headers

### TypeScript errors

- Run `npm run cf-typegen` to regenerate types after changing `wrangler.jsonc`
- Check `tsconfig.json` includes correct files
