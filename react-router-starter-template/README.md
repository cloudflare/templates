## Getting Started

### Installation

```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash

```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Typegen

Generate types for your Cloudflare bindings in `wrangler.toml`:

```sh

```

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

## Deployment

If you don't already have an account, then [create a cloudflare account here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) and after verifying your email address with Cloudflare, go to your dashboard and set up your free custom Cloudflare Workers subdomain.

Once that's done, you should be able to deploy your app:

```sh
npm run deploy
```

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.
