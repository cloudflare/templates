# Templates for Cloudflare Workers

Cloudflare Workers let you deploy serverless code instantly across the globe for exceptional performance, reliability, and scale. This repository contains a collection of starter templates for building full-stack applications on Workers. **You are encouraged to use, modify, and extend this code!**

## Getting Started

There are two ways to start building with a template in this repository: the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and [C3](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/c3/) (the `create-cloudflare` CLI).

### Starting from the Dashboard

After logging in or signing up through the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), open the [Workers templates page](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages/templates) and select a template to get started with. From here, you can create a repository and deploy your first Worker without needing a local development environment.

### Starting via CLI

To get started locally, run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest
# or
pnpm create cloudflare@latest
# or
yarn create cloudflare@latest
```

For more information on getting started with our CLI, check out the [getting started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/).
