<!-- dash-content-start -->

A modern full-stack template powered by [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), using [Hono](https://hono.dev/) for backend APIs, [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for frontend routing, and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for beautiful, accessible components styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Built with the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/) for optimized static asset delivery and seamless local development. React is configured in single-page app (SPA) mode via Workers.

A perfect starting point for building interactive, styled, and edge-deployed SPAs with minimal configuration.
