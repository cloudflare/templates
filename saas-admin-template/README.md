> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using C3 to create this project, select "no" when it asks if you want to deploy. You need to follow this project's [setup steps](https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/d1-template#setup-steps) before deploying.

## Setup Steps

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up your environment variables:

```bash
# Create a .dev.vars file for local development
touch .dev.vars
```

Add your API token:

```
API_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

_An API token is required to authenticate requests to the API. You should generate this before trying to run the project locally or deploying it._

3. Create a [D1 database](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/get-started/) with the name "admin-db":

```bash
npx wrangler d1 create admin-db
```
...and update the `database_id` field in `wrangler.json` with the new database ID.

4. Run the database migrations locally:

```bash
$ npm run db:migrate
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

_If you're testing Workflows, you should run `npm run wrangler:dev` instead._

5. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

6. Run the database migrations remotely:

```bash
$ npm run db:migrate:remote
```

7. Set your production API token:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put API_TOKEN
```

## Usage

This project includes a fully functional admin dashboard with customer and subscription management capabilities. It also includes an API with token authentication to access resources via REST, returning JSON data.

It also includes a "Customer Workflow", built with [Cloudflare Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows). This workflow can be triggered in the UI or via the REST API to do arbitrary actions in the background for any given user. See [`customer_workflow.ts`]() to learn more about what you can do in this workflow.
