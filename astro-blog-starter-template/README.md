## Getting Started

Outside of this repo, you can start a new project with this template using [C3](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/c3/) (the `create-cloudflare` CLI):

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --template=cloudflare/templates/astro-blog-starter-template
```

A live public deployment of this template is available at [https://astro-blog-starter-template.templates.workers.dev](https://astro-blog-starter-template.templates.workers.dev)

## 🚀 Project Structure

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

## Toolchain

This starter uses [Vite+](https://viteplus.dev). Use Node.js 24.22 or later in
Node.js 24, then install the dependencies with `npm install`. A global `vp`
installation is optional.

- `npm run check:toolchain` checks formatting and lint rules.
- `npm run format` formats the project.
- `npm run check` also runs this starter's existing project checks.

Use the documented development, build, and deployment scripts for this starter.
Framework commands and resource setup remain part of those scripts. Keep the
Vite alias and Vitest override aligned with the installed Vite+ release.

This starter keeps Astro 5's Vite version for framework builds. Vite+ supplies the
formatting and linting tools through its own bundled Vite; do not force Astro's
Vite dependency to the Vite+ alias until upgrading to a compatible Astro release.
